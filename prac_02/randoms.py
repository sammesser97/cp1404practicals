# I saw the number 12. Smallest number I could have seen was 5, largest was 20

# What did you see on line 2?
# What was the smallest number you could have seen, what was the largest?
# Could line 2 have produced a 4?
#
# I saw the number 3. Small number was 3, largest was 9. No it could not have produced a 4. it started at 3, and only
# produced a number every 2 integers from that, so 3, 5, 7, 9 and were the integers it would have produced
